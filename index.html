								<p>Mobile devices can be found in the hands of every person from every walk of life, and often from a very young age.  
								While the heavy use of technology and some apps and social platforms have been studied to be harmful for young developing minds, 
								the technology can also be applied to discover and improve the welfare and performance of young individuals.   
								This project concept is to develop an app for school students to provide feedback that can be collected by 
								teachers and the school for addressing issues with students’ social, psychological, and physical wellbeing; 
								and in turn, improve learning ability and general health.</p>
								<p>Insight is a school student survey mobile application. Our aim is to deliver a product that will improve the health and wellbeing of school children around the country through intuitive mobile applications.</p>

								<p> I’m Adam I am 27 years old from Sydney, Australia. I am apart of Epic Innovators for assignment 2 at RMIT university. My student number in S3851547. I currently work in the Australian Public Service. My main hobbies include travelling, golf and anything sport related. I’ve travelled to 22 countries and plan to visit many more in the years to come. My Interest in IT started at a very young age. Growing up as a child in the 90’s as the internet became the norm in everyone’s home meant new technologies were being developed constantly.
								As everything in life becomes more dependent on technology the need to be able to troubleshoot and fix issues with it increases. I’ve always taken a liking to being able to fix problems myself and setting up different technologies in my own home or friend’s & family’s homes. I’m hoping that my studies will be able to help me turn my hobby like interest in IT into a complete career. My Experience is limited within the IT world but my aptitude for problem solving and being efficient is a quality that I believe will help me learn and gain experience quickly. </p>

								<p> My name is Patrick Jenner and I am a member of the RMIT University group called the Epic Innovators. My Student number is s3831040. When I was a child, my father taught me how computers worked, which sparked my interest in IT. I would often help teachers ay my primary and later secondary school with computer related problems. Throughout secondary school I would research the latest hardware, upgrade my PC and playing. I worked in a computer shop where I would match the customers’ needs to the correct product and enjoyed it.</p>
